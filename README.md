# React-Clicky-Game
Fun Rick and Morty click-based memory game

##Overview
This application allows user to achieve higher score by clicking on images presented as cards. While the user clicks on the images, the images shuffle by changing their position. The user must click each image only once to guess and achieve one point to their score and if an image was clicked twice, the game resets.

##Motivation
The goal of this application is to use the create-react-app project as a starter to build react application faster and ready for development and production. Here I created a simple memory game with React UI components, managing component state, and responding to user events.

This project required me to break up UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. It's made by following up the instruction below. The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

##Built with:
- Javascript
- React
- Create React App
- HTML

##UI/UX
Built Reusable statelss react components using ES6 and JSX
Implemented Bootstrap library for styling components and building responsive layout
